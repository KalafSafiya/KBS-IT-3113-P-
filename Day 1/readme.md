# Prolog Day 1 Practicals

## Introduction
Welcome to **Prolog Day 1 Practicals**. In these exercises, we learned the basics of Prolog programming, including **facts, predicates, and queries**. Prolog is a logic programming language used for solving problems that involve **relationships, rules, and logical reasoning**.  

On Day 1, we focused on:
- Declaring **facts** about objects, animals, people, and other entities.
- Understanding **relationships** between entities (e.g., bigger than, eats, likes).
- Writing **queries** to retrieve information from a Prolog knowledge base.
- Feeding **knowledge about months and number of days**.
- Practicing a **family tree example**.

## Basic Rules
1. **Facts**: Statements about objects or relationships, e.g., `food(pizza).`  
2. **Predicates**: Functions that describe relationships or properties, e.g., `bigger_than(elephant,dog).`  
3. **Queries**: Questions asked to the Prolog system to check facts or relationships, e.g., `parent(bob,ann).`  
4. **Syntax**: 
   - All **atoms** (names, objects) should be in **lowercase**.  
   - **Variables** start with an **uppercase letter**.  
   - Every fact and rule ends with a **period (.)**.
